def is_fenced_code_block(text: str) -> bool:
    r"""Return whether *text* is a single fenced code block per the CommonMark spec.

    A fenced code block opens with a code fence — up to three spaces of
    indentation followed by a run of at least three backticks (```` ``` ````) or
    at least three tildes (``~~~``) — optionally followed by an info string on
    the same line.  When the fence is built from backticks, the info string may
    not contain a backtick.  The content runs until a closing fence (a line
    bearing only indentation of up to three spaces, fence characters of the same
    kind and at least the same count, and trailing whitespace) or, when there is
    none, to the end of *text* — a closing fence is optional in CommonMark.

    *text* qualifies only when it is wholly a single fenced code block: its first
    line is the opening fence and any closing fence is followed by nothing but
    blank lines.  A string whose opening fence is preceded by other content, or
    whose closing fence is followed by further content, returns ``False``.

    Args:
        text: The string to test.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if *text* is a single CommonMark fenced code block; ``False``
        otherwise.
