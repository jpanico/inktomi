"""Image asset fetching for the rendering pipeline — Pandoc-free.

Walks a :class:`~guffin.vertex_tree.VertexTree`, fetches every
:class:`~guffin.vertex.ImageVertex`'s Cloud Firestore asset to a local
directory via :func:`~guffin.roam.asset_fetch.fetch_and_cache_asset`, and
returns a ``{uid: ImageRef}`` mapping bundling each image's on-disk path and
native pixel size.

This module deliberately has no Pandoc/Panflute dependency so it can be shared
by rendering back-ends that must remain Pandoc-free.

Public symbols:

- :class:`ImageRef` — 3-way association of an image vertex's UID, on-disk path, and pixel size.
- :func:`fetch_images` — fetch all :class:`~guffin.vertex.ImageVertex` assets from a
  :class:`~guffin.vertex_tree.VertexTree` to a local directory; return a ``{uid: ImageRef}`` mapping.
- :func:`fetch_and_enrich_images` — :func:`fetch_images` plus tree enrichment; returns the
  ``original_image_size``-populated tree together with the ``{uid: ImageRef}`` mapping.
